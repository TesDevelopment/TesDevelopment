### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Im Josh You can call me Tes

I mostly work in lua though I work in Java/C#/PHP Sometimes. Im a student interested in computer science.

I know Java,Lua,PHP,MYSQL,C#, and Skript though I havent used Skript in years.

Im currently learning JavaScript/EJS

I spend most of my time either coding useless stuff,Xeron (My script hub),or chilling with freinds. Sometimes all of them at once.
